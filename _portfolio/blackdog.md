Millie skids her feet against the floor, with her hair in a messy bun. Her black hoodie towers over her head, protecting her from the meteoric rain and hail. Millie’s creased, white shoes are drenched in brown water, murky, glazed. She lets out a cry that navigates its way through the honks and beeps of cars on the highway. She wishes her smile could respectfully fade from her face. Thunder struck, BOOM BOOM, hell broke loose, and yet, it still didn’t feel the usual New York morning. 

She pulls her black hoodie up, and her new anonymous identity only discloses her crooked nose and chapped lips. A tear streams down her eyelashes, past her scraped cheekbone, and through the crevasse between her lips. Bitter coffee is overpowered by the salty sea that entered her mouth through Cupid’s bow. Under her hood, her black bangs fall past her eyebrows, obscuring the sight of her blue, downturned eyes. Her crippled, and maimed skin has turned pale, trail markers of angst, like flickering sparkles of heavy rain. The rain trickles down the lining of her hood, then her cheek, and down her chin.

As the puddles of rain dribble through the creases of Millie’s unzipped backpack, the pedestrians around her scoff at her beat-up jeans and creased shoes. She obliquely glances behind her to make sure they aren't looking anymore, but indeed they are. The rain continues to batter down on her head, now 2 blocks away from the apartment she dreaded to live in. Her heart pounds, her shoulders droop, her chest prone to the suffocating, muggy air. 

She reaches for the steps of her apartment, and trips. She lifts her leg up to reach the stairs which lay cliffed among the shallow lake that only reflect the mountainous avenue of steps of which her mind transcends her into thinking. To Millie, the steps only grow taller, and taller, and taller, and taller. Her knees surrender, her shoulders press down, and her hands lifelessly stretch. Small stones and pebbles pierce through her hand as she tries grappling onto the railing of her front porch. The fangs and intricate dents sunk into her leg as she struggled to lift herself up from her fall. Her crimson blood drips down her bruised knees, and her scabbed elbow hooks to the cement.

She propped on the doorknob and twisted it. Her hands slipped off of it, and her sweaty, blood-ridden hands stained the doorknob a bright crimson red as the orange light of her apartment’s kitchen weaved it way through each crevasse in the door. Her crimson blood shone in the moonlight which presented itself past the pattering rain. 

She dragged her backpack up the stairs, it bounced with every step it leaped. 

Tired, and worn out, she collapsed onto the floor.

A cloud of black dust formed around Millie’s shoulders and hooded the crown of her head. Naming it Thana, she became attached to the “spirit”, not knowing the dangers of which Thana had planned for in the distant future, starting from the daunting present.  A pair of shriveled hands emerged from the side of the dust cloud, with jagged fingernails armoring her wrinkly skin and fingertips. She mirrored Millie’s body - frail, matured, gaunt. One of Thana’s scrawny hands squished both her cheeks. Building little craters in her dry skin, almost as gray as the moon, Thana threw Millie’s head onto the ground-tauntingly. She cackled at the state of Millie, still collapsed on the floor, she wondered about who Thana is. If Thana really was in her head, who squished her cheeks, who called her traitor, was it Millie doing it herself? Where did Thana come from? Why was she so mean to her all the time? 

Although, she knew it wasn’t her saying everything Thana told her, she knew it must be, for who else could it be. Was it a disease? That’s what the therapists told her mother, that it was all in her head. Was Thana a hallucination? But, one thing she did know was that it only repeated one thing when she denied access to malice and spite:

Traitor.

Traitor.

Traitor.

Thana created Kallikon. Kallikon, Millie’s teddy bear, one of the only good things which happened in Millie’s life was ridden with scars, and dried blood which swelled and dried on Millie’s face like wax. Like Millie in public, its stitched smile fooled many, its exhausted laughter found in class, hibernated at home.

Still laying on the floor of her apartment entrance, Millie dragged herself on her splintering wood floor, the nails cut the skin on her belly, and rust formed scratches on her calves and thighs which she knew would leave dotted scars. Her hands trembled as she moved forward, reaching for Kallikon. 

Thana lifted her and put her on her knees and hands. Her posture eased as Millie caressed Kallikon’s body. Thana drew her legs forward, her body limp, as if Millie was a puppet and Thana the puppeteer. Millie unbuttoned her shirt and reached past her left breast. Her flesh split open. Millie maneuvered her small hands past her rib cage, and to the right of her lung. She swiftly detached her arteries from her heart, took it out. 

Thana peered over Millie’s shoulder, its torn black draped sleeves fell on her shoulder and placed its thin-fingered, black, and crinkled hand on Millie’s shoulder. 

Let your blood drip down your chest, your stomach, your thighs, your knees. Look at yourself in the mirror, you’re so ugly. Let another thrive, watch your face go pale, and your fingers grow purple. Watch as your eyes turn from brown, to blue, to gray. Give your heart to the bear. Trust me, your sorrow will soon end, and joy will flourish, just like when you were five.

Millie’s eyes revived at Thana’s words. 

All you have to do is give the heart to the bear. 

Her hands grew pale, the skin around her fingernails turned blue, deep red stained her light gray shirt. Staring at the still heart, Millie stood confused. She didn’t feel pain, just the blood gushing out of her body. 

Do it. Now.

Millie took a deep breath and pried some stuffing from inside the bear to make room for her heart. She left the purple heart inside the bear and folded it up as if it wore a cardigan on its  gold-brown fur. Kallikon’s chest held a fading red from within its fabric. Its ragged fabric flew in the wind as its chest rose. 

Millie collapsed. Her face turned even paler than it was before. She uncontrollably frowned and closed her eyes. She sunk into the wooden floors of her bedroom, and although she felt her heart race, it rapidly slowed down. Water dripped down thin strands of hair, and relaxed her jaw, it fell open. 

She groaned.

“The deed is done. Are you happy?” Millie said weakly. 

Thana leapt forward, not happy. 

Traitor. Parasite. You have no life, now it’s been given to me. 

Kallikon awoke, his eyes first enlightened with happiness, then he tilted his head in confusion at the sight of Millie’s dead corpse. He looked down at his faded-red chest, slightly confused. He looked out the window in awe, for he had never seen rain before! The red light which reflected off of a passing car's headlight blinded him. 

He grinned. Skipping out the door in happiness, Thana transformed into a small cloud of gas, and entered the bear's open mouth. 

Let hell break loose, and Kallikon’s heaven shatter. 

Kallikon skipped outside and embraced the wind, and the rain, and the sliver of moonlight which broke past the clouds. He stuck his arms out in the air, and spun around in circles. 

Kallikon was mesmerized by the many leaves, and collected them one by one. He was fascinated by the wild range of colors they left on the wet road. 

More and more people collected on the pavement and his aimless movements turned frantic. Kallikon tumbled to the side of the road, as a pedestrian kicked him aside into a water-filled pothole. The water splashed as Kallikon fell in. The leaves he collected escaped his paws. The water tremored, and rippled underneath his feet, and tears swept down his face. 

He got up, and wept, “Why is the world so cruel?”

He kept his hands to his eyes and looked up at the sky. Then he looked down, trying to hide the tears that flowed down his face. He looked up at the sky again, and screamed. His lips trembled, and nose twittered. 

A lightning bolt struck. Repeatedly he looked back up and down. He ran around in fear and distress, running into the road, naive to the dangers of the world which he lived in. A white car spotted him, honking at Kallikon, it went right, then left, then right, then left, then eventually, Kallikon ran past the car. 

“Get out of the way,” a stranger threatened, ”asshole.”

Looking at the car in disbelief and mortification, Kallikon panted. He had never heard such aggression. He walked off the road, looking down at his chest. He held it, with every inch of energy he had, and walked back to Millie. 

He couldn’t bear to live past the pain he held in this one night. The encounters he had been met with, left him with a great pain in his heart-a pain so intolerable-
not even the happiest entity, Kallikon, could tolerate.

That’s right Kallikon, you were not meant for this job. This job is for Millie. 

Unfazed by the voices which Thana spoke to him, he jumped onto Millie’s corpse.

Kallion lifted his dampened paw. He looked at it in disbelief, confused as to why the world treated him the way it did. 

“Was the world a person that set its mind on revenge-against me? Why must it seek revenge against me? What did I do? What’s wrong with me?” Kallikon asked repeatedly.

Kallikon curled his hand into a fist, and turned his hand over to look at the other side of his paw. Dirt and pebbles collected, stuck to Kallikon’s wet paw. He brushed off the debris with his other paw-he turned over his paw-once again. He stroked the spaces in between each of his fingers. 

Kallikon inhaled and reached into the slit which Millie made in Kallikon’s back. Navigating his way through the fluff in little body, he gripped onto Millie’s heart and quickly pulled it out before his entire body shut down again. 

Kallikon felt around Millie’s body trying to find the slit from which Millie took her heart out as he felt his sight and hearing slip away. Finally, Kallikon had found the slit underneath Millie's left breast, and placed it right next to her left lung.

He fell back into a deep sleep. 

Millie’s chest rose and her pale face turned back to the tanned skin color which Millie’s skin withstood. She looked at Kallikon. His fur was wrinkled and drenched with water. He leaned on the side of his right shoulder. His arms flopped forward, and his legs stretched the furthest of which he felt comfortable. The water dripped down his fur, just as it dripped down Millie’s strands of hair. His face turned from a great smile, to a great frown. 

Thana escaped Kallikon’s mouth and entered Millie’s.

He lived all the life that he needed, 2 hours-he lived. And so will you, won’t you traitor?

“Kallikon?” Millie cried, looking at the state of Kallikon.

Get the knife in the kitchen, so you can be reunited with him up there. 

Curious, she raced to the kitchen with no thought. She took out the knife from the drawer with a collection of culinary tools, and sprinted back to her room where she assumed Thana awaited her. 

Now take out your heart, and cut it with the knife. Trust me little traitor, it will all be over soon. 

She opened up the pocket inside her shirt and took out her heart. She gripped the knife in her right hand, and weakly chopped her heart down the middle.

Fool! Now you will die, and you will prance around the heavens like the fool you are! 

Millie returned to the state from when she gave her heart to Kallikon. Dead.

The door of her house opened, the sound of heels awoke, coming closer and closer to the door of Millie’s bedroom where her dead corpse lay. A woman appeared in the opening of the door, staring at Millie. 

“Millie,” the woman cried as she rushed over to her, “Millie, Millie wake up!”

There was no response, just a long-flatlining sound, and the cries of a mother who had just lost her child to the deception of Thana, the happiness and grief which held a deep burden on the mind of Millie’s soul, stored deep in her heart.
