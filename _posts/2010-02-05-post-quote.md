I hate that all depression art is the same,
all highlighted with dark colors.
Black.
Gray.
Dusty whites.
A pasty face
With
Inexpressive looks.
A mess, camouflaged among the streaks of light gray
background,
hiding one’s head, 
deformed with judgement
and apathy. 
Depression isn’t black and white–

it’s neon. 

Depression is
the eccentric orange
and yellow intertwined together, 
To make a neon red, 
reflecting on the anger 
and small bursts of 
spotless energy,
developed in one’s consciousness,
as the orange in caution cones
disturbing the stillness of wet sand,
signals distance
for their safety,
and mine.
It emboldens my need for 
isolation 
as the commotion on this path called life
disrupts the repose of mind.

It is the neon yellow
And its complexion.
The yellow of pulsing sight, injected in
the rainbow in air bubble skin,
as brief muffles of breath,
rise to the open, empty surface.
The clutches of neon green kelp 
choke me as I try to free myself
from the binding shackles of negativity.
Letting loose a blazing scene of 
blue and purple,
pink and white,
it is impossible to decipher 
which color is which.
My head spins 
Left, right
Up, down,
in defined circles.
Images,
twirling lights,
wreaths of false joy are displayed
in a now-closed ray of light,
settling the sandy sea floor
as the phantom air bubbles
are no longer visible.
