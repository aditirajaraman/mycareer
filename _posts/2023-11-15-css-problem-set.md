1. Make all of the paragraphs green
```
p {
   color: green;
}
```
2 Make an id called "large" and assign it to one of your headings
```
/* Then make "large" have a font size of 36px */
#large {
   font-size: 36px;
}
```
3. Make a class called "small" and assign it to the remaining two of your headings
```
/* Then make "small" have a font size of 12px */
/* Change the font to something you like as well */
.small {
   font-size: 12px;
   font-family: fantasy;
}
```
4. Adjust the margins, width, height AND filter of your image
```
img 
  display: solid; 
  width: 70%; 
  height: auto; 
  filter: grayscale(50%); 
  margin-left: 30 px; 
  margin-right: 30 px; 
  margin-top: 20 px; 
  margin-bottom: 20 px;
```
