**Diary Entry 1**
**2/25/2026:**
When I was three,
fireworks lit up the sky,
and bullets shot through.
the glass,
which now looked like spongebob,
as the unfilled holes,
built by,
bullets,
which left the white stained glass,
black,
made the glass tremble,
like the mini earthquakes,
we had to recreate in the orphanage.

BOOM’s,
shot through the sky;
BOOM,
BOOM,
BOOM.

The sky, 
fogged with my brain,
and left me,
in a disconclusive,
state.

I was 3,
and now I am 7,
survivor,
of the soviet soldiers,
who destroyed my pineapple,
home.

**Diary Entry 2**
**2/25/2031**
When I was 3,
the bullets,
contracted holes,
in the window,
in the door I always ran into,
in the ripped drapes which my cat, Cosco,
Made tears in.

They left a large scar,
on my homeland,
on Kyiv,
and my family.
But it left a big dent,
in the part of my heart,
which was only registered,
for my mother,
and father,
and big brother Derek. 

They were now dead,
as the soviet soldiers,
flooded the TV Channel,
Mother,
and Father,
called me for supper.
and now,
that supper,
was the last,
I would ever have with them.

I called their names that day,
lost,
and home-ridden. 
the only responses,
 I received,
kept only,
within the graveyard,
that was the cement,
and grass,
in my backyard,
where the Soviet,
slit the ground’s throat,
and my mother’s,
in a distant memory.
Where the un-tried murder,
of an innocent,
woman
took place,
did the foreign speakers,
attack.
Where my mother’s scream,
jabbed,
a permanent dent in my heart.

I was 3,
and now I am 12,
survivor,
of the soviet soldiers,
who destroyed my pineapple,
home.

**Diary Entry 3**
**2/25/2037**
When I was 3,
the damning rain,
met my brother’s,
bloody cheeks,
and 
married the blood,
he coughed up,
as the bullet,
of the soviet, pierced his abdomen.

Through the corner of my eye,
could I only see,
the sight,
which met my brother’s,
blood-ridden,
imbrued eyes,
just before his heart,
gave out.

Just before,
his heart,
beat,
its last beat.

I was 3,
when the philosophies,
and literacies, 
of which I considered home,
were ridden with blood,
and investigation.


The golden domes of, 
tall buildings,
lined along the skylines of Kyiv, 
were crowded with,
smoke,
ash,
and fumes of the,
parasitic,
bitter,
foul stench of,
death. 

I was 3, 
now I am 18 years old.
survivor,
of the soviet soldiers,
who destroyed my pineapple,
home.
