<!-- <p>I am a student at John P. Stevens High School and pursuing a career of research and biology - specifically, genomics. My aim is to utilize the integration of Artificial Intelligence(AI), statistical analysis, and biology to build the future of Earth and technology. I have a strong foundation in programming languages, Python and CSS/HTML/JS, & scientific research. At the age of 14, I developed a research project about a solution for Ischemic Strokes alongside my science teacher, which I later presented at a statewide fair in front of a crowd of 50+ families and high school science teachers/college professers. </p>-->

<!-- <p>Aside from my academic and scientific personal responsibilities, I am an avid tennis player and a creative writer. I am on my high school varsity tennis team. I have also used my creative writing skills to bring awareness of controversial topics. Some of these pieces include takes on the interpretation of depression, the Black Lives Matter(BLM) movement of 2020, and the Ukraine/Russian War.</p>

<p>I believe that with my ambition and passion, I will be able to make a difference in the world of tomorrow. I believe that the revolutionary field of genomics and bioinformatics can be further developed with the introduction of my ideas.</p> -->  

Hello! I am a student at John P. Stevens High School and pursuing a career in bioinformatics. My interests include Artificial Intelligence(AI), the biological sciences, and scientific research. 

In my free time, I investigate multiple subtopics of Biology(e.g. genomics, molecular biology, etc.) and Artificial Intelligence(AI). I am proficient in a multitude of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python. I also indulge in great amounts of creative writing pieces, whether that be reading, or writing. 

In the eighth grade, I proposed a prognostic solution which detected the early onset of Ischemic strokes in heart patients. Additionally, I received a variety of Statewide creative writing awards with acceptance rates of less than 5%.
